// 1) Why use a for loop vs. a forEach and vice versa?

// A for each loop is cleaner and can provide more readability.

// 2) What is a higher order function?

// A higher order function is a function that can take in other functions as arguments.

// 3) What is a callback function?

// A callback function is a function that is to be executed after another function has finished executing.
// Also, any function that is passed as an argument is a callback function.

// 4) What is the difference between =, ==, and ===?

// = is assigning a value, while == (value) and === (value & type) are comparison operators

// 5) What is an IIFE and why is best practice to wrap your JS code in one?

// An IIFE is a container of sorts that isolates variable declarations from the global scope. They also
// execute functions immediately.

// 6) What is Strict Mode and why is a best practice to use it when writing JS code?

// strict mode is called at the beginning of your js code to provide stricter parameters within the syntax.
// It is best practice to use this to help catch errors.

// 7) What kind of data is best stored in an array and what kind of data is best stored in an object?



// 8) Why define an object in a single statement vs. dynamically adding properties and values in seperate statements?

// Single statement should be used when you have all the data you need then and there.

// 9) Are strings in JS mutable or immutable? What about arrays and objects?


// Why does the following code log the number 3 and not the number 1?
//   var x = {a: 1, b:2};
//   var y = x;
//   x.a = 3;
//   console.log(y.a);

// Because the values, even though they have different names, are still the same values.
